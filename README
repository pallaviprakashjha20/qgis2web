# My Experience Installing Xubuntu and Using QGIS2Web

I shrank my E: drive to create 200 GB of unallocated space for installing Xubuntu.  
I then used Rufus to prepare a bootable USB drive and launched the Xubuntu installer (Xubuntu 22.04.5 LTS "Jammy Jellyfish").  

During installation:  
- The unallocated space appeared as free space (no longer shown under E:)  
- Created a 60 GB root (`/`) partition for Xubuntu  
- Used remaining space for `/home` and swap  

After installation, I used the terminal to install QGIS with `sudo` privileges.  
The system automatically selected QGIS 3.22.4-Białowieża for my OS. Installation was successful. QGIS runs smoothly on my Dell Inspiron 5458 (Signature Edition, 8 GB RAM, 2.4 GHz Intel Core i7, 2017).

## Using QGIS2Web

Since my project and layers were set to **EPSG:32645 (WGS 84 / UTM Zone 45N)**, I used the **qgis2web plugin** and selected **OpenLayers** for exporting HTML files.

> OpenLayers supports projected coordinate systems more reliably than Leaflet, ensuring accurate geometry and spatial alignment in the published web map.
